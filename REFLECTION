I found it to be very challenging to follow the provided instructions and install GitHub/Git. I am not particularly
literate with terminal/command-line/bash, and the instructions relied on already having a working knowledge of this. 
I encountered further obstacles with authentication when attempting to configure my account and push changes.

I see the value of GitHub when working on projects, because it allows you to freeze versions in time, allowing later access.
This can be useful for large projects because it allows multiple programmers to troubleshoot at the same time, 
while not having to alter the main code.
